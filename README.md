# music-player-QT-CSC22100 #
Our project was to create a music player called qTunes, which mimics an earlier version of iTunes, which had the usage of the cover flow to view album art. In our program, the user is able to select the directory of their choice which has the music files and load it into the program. After loading the music into the program, it will place the music and their respective tags into a table and different panels that allow the user to sort the music. In addition, the cover flow will be enabled, where the album art of the respective music files will be shown.Â
